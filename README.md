# Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction
A newly minted data scientist with a solid foundation from a rigorous bootcamp and a prior career in Control Systems Engineering. My expertise includes Python, SQL, and various machine learning techniques. I'm excited to apply my diverse skill set to solve real-world problems. Check out my projects and feel free to reach out to me.

## Projects

### Project 1: Titanic Dataset
- **Objective:** Predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
- **Techniques Used:** Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Hyperparameter Tuning.
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Outcome:** Achieved an accuracy of 82% with Random Forest model.
- **Details:** This project is split into two parts:
  - **Part 1:** [Feature engineering.](titanic_dataset/Titanic_Dataset_part1_feature_engineering.ipynb)
  - **Part 2:** [Solving the classification problem.](titanic_dataset/Titanic_Dataset_part2_solving_classification_problem.ipynb)

### Project 2: [Weight Prediction](weight_prediction/Weight_prediction.ipynb)
- **Objective:** Predict the weight of individuals based on gender and height.
- **Techniques Used:** Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Data Transformation.
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn.
- **Outcome:** Created a simple yet effective model for weight prediction.

### Project 3: [Fake News Detector](fake_news_detector/Fake_news_detector.ipynb)
- **Objective:** Classify news articles as real or fake.
- **Techniques Used:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, Passive Aggressive Classifier, SVM Classifier.
- **Tools:** Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn.
- **Outcome:** Developed a model with a score 93% on the test set.

### Project 4: [Predictive Maintenance](https://predmaintdemo.streamlit.app/)
- **Objective:** Predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of equipment to enable proactive maintenance.
- **Techniques Used:** Feature Engineering, Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Hyperparameter Tuning.
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit.
- **Outcome:** Implemented a model that predicts RUL with RMSE ~18.
